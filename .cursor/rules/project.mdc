# Project Rules (must follow)

## Goal

Build a mobile app (Expo RN) that records voice answers, sends audio to server for transcription + feedback analysis, then displays structured feedback.

## Constraints

- Keep it simple. No premature abstractions.
- No global scores in UI. Only labels: low/medium/high, too_short/ok/too_long.
- JSON-only responses from the AI endpoints.
- Error states must be explicit and user-friendly.

## Architecture

- app/ = Expo React Native (TypeScript)
- server/ = Express TypeScript
- server exposes:
  - POST /transcribe (multipart audio) -> { transcript: string }
  - POST /analyze (json) -> { clarity, length, weak_words, suggestion, ... }

## Coding standards

- TypeScript strict
- Small modules, 1 responsibility
- Prefer functional components + hooks in app
- Validate inputs on server (zod)
- No secrets in repo (env only)

## Deliverables

- Working E2E flow: record -> upload -> transcript -> analyze -> feedback screen.
